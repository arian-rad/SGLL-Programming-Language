ABOUT SGLL:
SGLL is a programming language named after one of S.Hedayat's books.



Requirements:
SLY is a lexing and parsing tool which makes our process much easier.


Building a Lexer:
The first phase of a compiler is to convert all the character streams(the high level program that is written) to token streams. This is done by a process called lexical analysis. However, this process is simplified by using SLY
